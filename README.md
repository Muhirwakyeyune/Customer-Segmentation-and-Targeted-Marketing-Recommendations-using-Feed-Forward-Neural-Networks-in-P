# Neural-networks
here is an implementation of a feedforward neural network using PyTorch that can be used for marketing purposes to analyze customer data and make targeted marketing recommendations.

We will use the "Iris" dataset for this implementation,
which is a well-known dataset used for classification problems. 
The dataset contains information about different types of Iris flowers, 
and our task is to classify the flowers into different types based on their features.
